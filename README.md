Coding Assessment - Walmart – Software Engineer Mobile (Android)

by Roman Soloviov

 Display all the countries in a RecyclerView ordered by the position they appear in the
JSON.
 
The user should be able to scroll thru the entire list of countries.
The implementation should be robust (i.e., handle errors and edge cases) and
support device rotation.
The goal is to write high-quality code for the portion you choose to implement, not the
number of features implemented.
